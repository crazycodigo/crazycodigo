# Who are We?

We are J and A - two coders with a passion for procrastination. We started Crazy Codigo in June, 2021 as a way to keep track of all the projects we start and actually finish them.
We are CSE students in India and still learning. So, you pretty much get to join us on our coding journey and see our ideas and projects evolve as we move forward.
